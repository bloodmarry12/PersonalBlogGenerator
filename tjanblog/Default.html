                    Greetings, guys and gals. Welcome again to my blog site, a place to demo all my
                    ideas on Internet. From certain view, this blog works like a lab or a garage 
                    to me. I believe that all developers will agree on the necessity of an online 
                    access to their documents, codes, services and stuff like that. Well, at long 
                    last, I have my own access now.
                </p>
                <h2>Something about me.</h2>
                <p>
                    I, myself, am a sort of simple guy. Nothing in my life was so special that need to be 
                    mentioned about, which actually pains me quite a lot, you know. As a programmer, it 
                    is a shame that I cannot introduce myself in form like "the author of SOMETHING". 
                    Of course, I did wrote some pieces during my college time, working days and spare 
                    time. The only problem is that the author, that is me, is not satisfied with these 
                    works. This, as part of the reason, leads to this blog -- I believe that it is the 
                    time to <strong>make a difference</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a programmer, I classify myself into so called ployglot type. Like many 
                    people in China, <a href="http://pascal-central.com/ppl/">Pascal</a> and C 
                    lead me to the world of programming at my middle school time. 
                    C++ came naturally to me in my college days. Right on the 2015 New Year 
                    Day, I quitted my position as a C++ developer in a power grid automation vendor. 
                    From then on, I started my <a href="http://fsharp.org/">F#</a> days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technically speaking, I am still a will-be ployglot. Writing simple codes in 
                    certain language does not make you a this-language programmer. Otherwise, I 
                    believe there will be a huge number of HTML programmers, CSS programmers, or 
                    Javascript programmers. An insight and understanding of the logic using certain 
                    programming language is the very baseline of mastering a programming language. 
                    With this standard, I am just a C++/F# bilingual (a poor one maybe).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am on my way of mastering <a href="http://www.racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>, 
                    <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> and <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">
                    Rust</a> languages while diving deeper into C++ and F#. Recently, cloud computing 
                    and machine learning have come to my view.
                </p>
                <h2>What will there be here?</h2>
                <p>
                    Mainly blog posts of course. But something I have to say is that as a Chinese
                    programmer with just common English training in my middle school and university,  
                    most of my posts will be written in 中文 rather than English. You can
                    check the contents of my blog posts using the topbar <em>Contents</em> button. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    And I plan to share some spare time project entries in this blog. Besides 
                    the description blog post, visitors may find the entries by clicking the <em>
                    Tests</em> button on the topbar of this page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This site is created with a self-written static site generator. This is an 
                    exercising F# project from the book <em><a href="http://www.manning.com/petricek2/">
                    F# Deep Dives</a></em> at first. But it is part of my automatic building and 
                    deploying system now. Therefore, just like other live projects, you may expect 
                    more features, different appearance or even new site structure here.
                </p>
                <h2>So, you want a talk?</h2>
                <p>
                    Oh, if you want to contact with me. You can find my email and Weibo (a popular 
                    Twitter like tool in China) number in the <em>Contact</em> page. Contact will be
                    updated in time. I am looking forward to the conversation with you.
